\part{Nodes}
\todo[inline]{Each person will write this section based on the one you
  have worked on}
In the software architecture section the specifications for each node
was discussed.  This section deals with the actual implementation of
each node.  This includes problems encountered, solutions found, and
future plans

\input{velocity_profiler}


\input{look_ahead}

\missingfigure{Attach an image of the derivation of the geometry for
  the look ahead box}

\input{steering_node}

\section{Path Planner Node}
Currently we are using hard coded paths, however, these paths are
being sent out in path segments using the PathSegment message type.

Our next major task will be to get the path planner node working using
the methods described in our book and in class.

\section{Vision Node}

This node is not currently implemented, but in the future it will use
data from the Kinect to do its job(s).
