\part{Overview}

\section{Team Members and Responsibilities}
\todo[inline]{Who worked on what specifically}

The members of the alpha team and their respective roles are:

Devin Schwab - Group Leader, Velocity Profiler

Mark Shultz - Steering

David Jannotta - Path Planning

Eddie Massey - Sensors


\section{Project Goals}
\todo[inline]{What we would like our robot to do at the end of the
  semester.}
The main goal for the semester is to program a robot that is capable
of taking in sensory information from the environment and then use
that information to autonomously plan goals and execute them.  To
accomplish this overall goal multiple capabilities will need to be
added to the robot.  These capabilities include:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Take in goal destinations and calculate a path based on stored
  map information and current location
\item Autocorrect path when obstacles are detected
\item Correct trajectory using a steering algorithm
\item Detect objects using the Kinect camera and autonomously plan
  actions based on the data
\end{enumerate}

\section{Schedule and Milestones}
\todo[inline]{Not sure if this is necessary. But will include when
  things were accomplished and when things are planned to be accomplished}

\section{Tools}
\todo[inline]{E.g. Git and roslaunch files}

\subsection{Git}

In order to keep track of the different versions of our source files
we are using git.  Our git repository can be found at
\url{https://github.com/rhololkeolke/EECS-376-Alpha}.  Using Git has
allowed us to work in parallel on the different files in our source
code and merge the various edits together.  It also has the added
benefit of keeping track of every version of our source code. There
have been many times that we have tried new changes, found they didn't
work and had to revert back to an earlier working version.

In order to keep everything organized each of us has a branch for
development.  We have also have a main branch called develop in which
we merge everyone's individual commits and do final tweaks. Every
demo is merged into master and tagged for future reference.

Below is a picture of the graph of our git repository.
