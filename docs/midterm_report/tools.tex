\subsection{Roslaunch Files}
There are presently two roslaunch files which launch the steering, velocity profiler, look ahead, and estop nodes. ``alpha$\textunderscore$simulator.launch''also starts Harlie's 2nd floor simulation launch file.``alpha$\textunderscore$robot.launch'' includes the no teleoperator and 2nd floor launch files. Simply using these launch files are much faster than opening six different terminal windows to start the robots operation.

Roslaunch files are going to do more than cut down on the number of terminal windows we have to open and close after each compile, it will also serve as a marker to determine if our node structure is organized properly and there is enough data encapsulation between nodes. Since roslaunch ``does not provide any guarantees about what order nodes start in (ROS)'' we will have to be sure that our nodes are flexible enough to start in any order and that no node handling unecessary data. With the combination of ehancment and testability ROS launch files will be a very useful tool in the design implementations of our robot.
