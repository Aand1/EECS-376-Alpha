\section{ROS Packaging and Stacks}

We have been utilizing ROS stacks to manage our individual ROS packages.
We will try to use a single package per node. This will encourage
appropriate message passing between nodes and make sure they are not too
tightly coupled.

Another benefit is that rosmake will build packages that don't depend
on one another in parallel.  This decreases the build time by a small
amount, which is especially useful when making small changes during testing.

Stacks utilize a \texttt{stack.xml} file which contains dependencies to
be included for every package. The ROS stack will automatically build
all packages within it's root directory.
