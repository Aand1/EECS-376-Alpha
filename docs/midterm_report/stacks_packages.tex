\section{ROS Stack Management}

We have been utilizing ROS stacks to manage our individual ROS packages.
We will try to use a single package per node. This will encourage
appropriate message passing between nodes and make sure they are not too
tightly coupled.

Stacks utilize a \texttt{stack.xml} file which contains dependencies to
be included for every package. The ROS stack will automatically build
all packages within it's root directory.

Complete documentation can be found at the
